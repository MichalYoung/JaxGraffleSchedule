# JaxGraffleSchedule

Convert CSV schedule entries to JAX commands for OmniGraffle to draw the schedule

Main code is in the 'graffle' folder. 
Seeds of a version to produce HTML in 'html' folder, currently on hold. 

Long-term plan is to factor out OmniGraffle-specific parts into "driver" and have 
multiple targets (OmniGraffle, HTML, SVG) in separate folders.  Not yet!
